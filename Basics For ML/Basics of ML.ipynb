    "<b> What is Artificial Intelligence ?</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "    Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. Artificial intelligence is a theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> What is Machine Learning ?</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "    Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine Learning helps us to develop computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b> What is Deep Learning ?</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "    Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Similarly to how we learn from experience, the deep learning algorithm would perform a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b> What are differnet types of Machine Learning ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily three types of machine learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Supervised Learning :- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train machine learning models. In labeled data, the output is already known. The model just needs to map the inputs to the respective outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    An example of supervised learning is to train a system that identifies the image of an animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Unsupervised Learning :- Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses unlabeled data to train machines. Unlabeled data doesn’t have a fixed output variable. The model learns from the data, discovers the patterns and features in the data, and returns the output. \n",
    "    An example of unsupervised learning is such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Reinforcement Learning :- Reinforcement Learning trains a machine to take suitable actions and maximize its rewards in a particular situation. It uses an agent and an environment to produce actions and rewards. The agent has a start and an end state. But, there might be different paths for reaching the end state, like a maze. In this learning technique, there is no predefined target variable. \n",
    "    An example of reinforcement learning is to train a machine that can identify the shape of an object, given a list of different objects.\n",
    "   \n",
    "<b> Different kinds of Machine Learning Tasks :- </b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "All of the Machine Learning algorithms take data as input, but what they want to achieve is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be broadly be classified in a few groups based on the task they are designed to solve. These tasks are: classification, regression and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Classification :- Classification is a supervised learning task used when we need a limited set of outcomes. It generally provides predicted output values, which may be  True or False.  It performs in the way of two types such as Binomial and Multi-Class. For example, we can find whether a received email is Spam or Not.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Regression :- The regression task comes from Supervised machine learning. Which can help us to predict (expect continues values) and explains objects based on a given set of numerical and categorical data. For example, we can predict house prices based on house attributes such as several rooms, size, and location.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Clustering :- An unsupervised learning technique performs as a way of grouping related items together into various clusters. It doesn’t have any output information for the training process. Nonetheless, the clustering algorithm will define the output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4) Dimensionality Reduction :- An unsupervised learning task used to reduce redundant information from large data sets. It provides less computation and reduces training time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we will learn about different kind of datasets we uses in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1) Training Data :-</b> The sample of data used to fit the model. The actual dataset that we use to train the model. The model sees and learns from this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2) Validation Data :- </b>The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3) Testing Data :- </b> The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Validation set actually can be regarded as a part of training set, because it is used to build your model. It is usually used for parameter selection and to avoild overfitting.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different kind of Distance Measures used in ML :->\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Euclidean Distance :- Euclidean distance is the distance between two points. To find the two points on a plane, the length of a segment connecting the two points is measured.\n",
